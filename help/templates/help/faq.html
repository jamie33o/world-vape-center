						In a world where we continuously see ‘e-‘ slapped onto the prefix of
						anything, understanding terms is tough. For example, many people see the
						term ‘e-cigarette’ and wonder what they would actually be ‘smoking’. Are you
						smoking data? Are you smoking and enjoying a rich cloud of Wi-Fi? What’s
						going on here, exactly? Fear not, the electronic cigarette is nothing like
						what other ‘e-‘ systems are. They are a form of electronic cigarette that
						offers a chance for a more flavoursome, enjoyable smoke. It’s an alternative
						to yellow teeth, stinky clothes and dirty fingernails. It’s the alternative
						to the classic smoking product of tobacco in a paper skin. Basically, vaping
						from e-cigarettes is a consumer-created solution to the tobacco problem.
						E-cigarettes are basically battery-powered objects that are useful for the
						act of vaporizing (nicotine) liquid, thus giving rise to the feel of smoking
						a real cigarette. Using this kind of e-cigarettes can lend your mind a light
						buzz that is similar to that of when you smoke a real cigarette. However, in
						this case, you must know, this buzz comes from the vapor given out by the
						e-cigarette is lined with and not the smoke like in the case of an actual
						cigarette.

						Of course, to use an e-cigarette you can’t just drop normal tobacco into the
						slot and go for it. You need to use what is known as e-liquid. E-liquid is
						used in vapor products such as e-cigarettes and usually, it’s made with a
						rich blend of ingredients, including: E-liquid Bottles Icons Propylene
						Glycol (PG) – helps to produce more of that throat hit feel and less smoke
						than VG. It has thinner consistency so it’s more friendly to your
						replaceable coils. However, the majority of e-liquids on the market contains
						50% VG and 50% PG mix just to get you a bit of everything. For more info
						about PG/VG ratios click here. Vegetable Glycerine (VG) – helps to make
						those large, thick vapour clouds you see people producing. It’s a clear,
						odourless liquid produced from plant oils and in your e-cigarettes provides
						vapor with a smoother hit. Flavouring – E-liquid on its own is hard to take.
						With a flavouring, you can enjoy a much richer taste and something more
						fitting to your needs. Most new vapors start with tobacco flavoured
						e-juices. Eventually, most e-cig users switch to more popular fruit and
						dessert based flavours. Nicotine (optional) – The ingredient that allows you
						to enjoy the smoking experience and get the same benefits of using a normal
						cigarette in terms of nicotine intake. Remember, that nicotine is an
						occurring liquid alkaloid which is an organic compound. Nicotine is totally
						optional in your e-cigarette. When you pick up an e-cigarette, you will have
						a fine collection of e-liquids to try out as you go along or you might make
						your own e-liquid. The result? A form of smoking that’s nothing like the
						regular option. If you want to try out something with a wholesale difference
						to normal smoking, then you might just get exactly what you need from here.
						You can choose from tobacco, juicy fruit e-liquids, or are you fancy for
						something sweet? There’s so many to choose from, so take your pick and
						enjoy!

						When it comes to using a good vaporizer and e-cigarette solution, the main
						challenge comes from knowledge. With so many different forms of nicotine
						available in an e-liquids, choosing is hard work! One question you might
						have, for example, will revolve around nicotine levels. Go too weak, and
						you’ll get little out of the service. Go too strong, though, and you’ll find
						it hard to enjoy. How do you work it out, then? We recommend that you take a
						look through this simple guide. We’re going to break down the best way to
						choose nicotine strength levels and flavours. So, the first thing to know is
						that you get many forms of nicotine strength. From 0mg to 20mg, you can get
						all manner of strengths. It’s more to do with making sure that you get a
						nicotine level that is right for your system. Too much can leave you feeling
						rather ill; too little can feel like you are wasting time and money. If you
						used to smoke normal cigarettes, then it’s likely that you’ll have gone for
						a stronger substance to begin with. However, you need to think about your
						smoking habits as much as smoking strength. Many people who move into
						e-cigarettes from normal cigarettes go for a stronger level of nicotine,
						despite being light-to-medium smokers beforehand. Many people wind up using
						a volume much higher than their previous habit. For example, we see lots of
						people who were a 5-10 cigarette a day smoker using e-liquids for a 40-a-day
						smoker! Naturally, you want to avoid this. Doing so can make it hard for you
						to help kick your habit. The stronger the kick is from the e-liquid, the
						more likely it is you’ll keep up that habit. Typically, we would try to
						break it down to roughly this: E-liquid with 0mg nicotine doesn’t have any
						nicotine at all and you should expect to be extra smooth and enjoyable. If
						you smoke 5 cigarettes per day go for a 3 mg level. This is a good level
						that most people prefer. With just a small amount of nicotine, there is very
						little throat hit. 6mg of nicotine is still a good option for smooth and
						medium rich throat hit but still, it’s not quite the strength of a normal
						cigarette. If you smoke 20 cigarettes a day, go for 12mg levels. Still
						enjoyable but you should feel a rich and medium throat hit which about 80%
						of the strength of that in a regular cigarette. Should you want something
						very heavy? Go for 18mg. Expect to be comparable to a normal cigarette that
						provides you with bold throat hit.

						Of course, flavour is very much a subjective thing. Some people love the
						fruit-flavoured models, others like the candy-flavoured stuff. Some people
						find this entirely needless, and just want a good old nicotine taste.
						Whatever your choice is, though, you can usually mix in the flavour with the
						strength. For example, fluffier and lighter flavours tend to be lighter on
						the nicotine count. Harsher, stronger flavours tend to be higher up on the
						mg count. It all depends on what you enjoy most, but flavour is much more
						subjective than the strength count. Next time you are buying e-liquid, then,
						consider the above to make sure you get a specialist solution that suits
						your wants and needs. You might just be smoking the entirely wrong strength
						and volume of e-liquid!
