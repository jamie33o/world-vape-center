# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

Throughout the development of this project, I've carried out numerous tests to ensure that the site works well. In this section you will find documentation of all tests carried out throughout the site.

## Code Validation

I have validated all of my code using the recommended tools for each language.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test `
